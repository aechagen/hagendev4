*Spoiler alert:* This a long-winded post about my life at this point.

With the help of a newly discovered favorite Youtuber Matt D’Avella, I decided to follow his lead and [quit social media for 30 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8_YhWoq2o). A couple of things led to this decision for me:

I invested way too much time with social media as a whole. Naturally, this takes me away from doing productive things.
When I browse social media, I fall into a “keeping up with the Joneses” phase with my peers, especially those in the Navy.
Nothing against those that recently commissioned as officers, or surpassed me in rank, or completed C-school to better themselves. This just caused me really take a deep dive in my thoughts and think about where I am now, and where I would like to be in the future. As of today, it has been 40 days since I quit Facebook and Instagram. Just for kicks, I decided to reinstall Facebook on my phone and see what it was like, fully expecting to be fully absorbed once again.

*Plot twist:* I don’t think I’ll keep it on my phone longer than the weekend.

The thing is, this past month has made me realize that the things that I focused on when I wasn’t aimlessly scrolling through my feeds are way more important. In the past month, I’ve focused on my school, bettering my habits and daily life choices, my relationship with my wife and my kids, and -pretty consistently for the past few days- rediscovering the newly recreated 3D version of Kanto in Pokemon Let’s Go Pikachu. On top of that, I’ve been reading more and listening to more audiobooks. On top of that, I even started coding and blogging, the latter of which I’ve been wanting to do for a while. (Wow, I’ve done a lot with my time this past month).

Looking back on it all, I’m glad that I made that snap decision to disconnect from social media and reconnect with the things that really matter to me.
