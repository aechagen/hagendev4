## The good stuff

I had a lot of good times in 2018. To kick it off, our youngest son Evan was born. It was a tough road getting home after his birth, because myself, Elijah and Ethan all came down with the flu right after he was born. We were fortunate enough to have our Vegas family over here (two separate times!). We took a trip to visit family back in the states just in time for my niece's first birthday, and I even made the transition to another position at work. I took six classes towards my Bachelor's Degree in Healthcare Administration, maxing out my allowed Tuition Assistance. Towards the last half of the year, I took a deep dive into my habits and what I wanted to change about what I do each day, which leads to me to..

## The not-so-good stuff

The things that I set out to do, the stuff I wanted to accomplish.. Forget about it. I probably started out strong with coding, getting better at chess, reading more, implementing date nights, running more, riding my bike to work, saving money, not yelling at my kids.. but I know how I ended up: Not doing any of it. On one hand, it's nice because I didn't write anything down to make this feeling of disappointment in myself that I have worse. On the other hand, I'm beating myself up for not documenting at all. Looking back at it now, it looks like I hardly did anything that I wanted to do. 

On the bright side, the latter part of the year (starting November, really), I decided to take a break from FaceBook and really start to get to the bottom of why I can't stick to what I say I'm going to do. I started reading more instead of playing video games and spending time with family instead of being glued to FaceBook all the time. I started to ramp up my blog back in November, and I think that helps with some of the stress. I even started taking home videos. 

## Looking forward

As for tangible and measurable goals, here we go: 
- Date night once per month
- Read 10 books
- Bike to work at least once per week
- Cook something **new** once per week
- Run enough to earn my Harry Potter Running Club medals from 2017. Yes, from 2017. 
  - Mad-Eye Moody Constant Vigilance 5K
  - Hogwarts Running Club 9 3/4K
  - Sirius Black Half Marathon
  - (Here they are!)

- Save least $500 for a starting emergency fund
- Take more home videos
- Blog post twice a month

For the not-so-tangible:
- Be more patient with your kids
- Stop being so broke all the time
- Learn how to stay motivated and finish what you start

Well, I guess that's pretty much everything. I hope that 2019 isn't a repeat of 2018. I'm thankful for my family and the people I am able to work with on a daily basis. I'm extremely lucky in that aspect to have such great and supportive people around me. 

Thanks for reading!
