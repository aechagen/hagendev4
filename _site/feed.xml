I had no idea such a cool thing existed before I came across them in FreeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design certification, but after refactoring the CSS for this site using them, I love it. I’ll admit, my admiration for CSS variables came entirely from my being extremely lazy to learn how to use SCSS with WordPress, but hey. It’s something new to me, and I enjoy it. Lets talk about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS variables can be extremely useful in reducing repetition in CSS, and in advanced cases, they can be used for cool effects like theme switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repetition-in-css&quot;&gt;Repetition in CSS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there. Repetition and clutter plague us all at some point, whether we like to admit it or not. Repeating color values is an example of CSS that is used constantly through a web page in order to keep styles consistent. The issue with repeating the color values in your CSS is that it’s potentially error-prone. Sure, you could “find and replace” all the things, but it could get dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-custom-properties-aka-custom-properties&quot;&gt;Enter Custom Properties, aka Custom Properties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are CSS variables in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#4ABDAC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--header-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#FFFFFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#DFDCE3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--accent-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#F7B733&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;--background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;--header-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple, right? You define the variables in :root, which means they can be accessed throughout the entire document. Then, you call them when you need them with var(). Supes easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cascading-and-inheritance&quot;&gt;Cascading and Inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as CSS is subject to cascading and inheritance, so are its custom properties. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;--acent-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:focus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--accent-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;600px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--accent-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;midnightblue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.. And there you have it! By using the same custom property, we’re able to have different values in different places on the same page. Neato!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s my take on CSS variables and how I use them. I like the organizational aspect that comes with using them, and I know for a fact that there are a lot more use cases for them out there. Hoping to pick more of these up as I go, but it looks like I found a replacement for SCSS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of a newly discovered favorite Youtuber Matt D’Avella, I decided to follow his lead and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8_YhWoq2o&quot;&gt;quit social media for 30 days&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of things led to this decision for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invested way too much time with social media as a whole. Naturally, this takes me away from doing productive things.
When I browse social media, I fall into a “keeping up with the Joneses” phase with my peers, especially those in the Navy.
Nothing against those that recently commissioned as officers, or surpassed me in rank, or completed C-school to better themselves. This just caused me really take a deep dive in my thoughts and think about where I am now, and where I would like to be in the future. As of today, it has been 40 days since I quit Facebook and Instagram. Just for kicks, I decided to reinstall Facebook on my phone and see what it was like, fully expecting to be fully absorbed once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plot twist:&lt;/em&gt; I don’t think I’ll keep it on my phone longer than the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, this past month has made me realize that the things that I focused on when I wasn’t aimlessly scrolling through my feeds are way more important. In the past month, I’ve focused on my school, bettering my habits and daily life choices, my relationship with my wife and my kids, and -pretty consistently for the past few days- rediscovering the newly recreated 3D version of Kanto in Pokemon Let’s Go Pikachu. On top of that, I’ve been reading more and listening to more audiobooks. On top of that, I even started coding and blogging, the latter of which I’ve been wanting to do for a while. (Wow, I’ve done a lot with my time this past month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on it all, I’m glad that I made that snap decision to disconnect from social media and reconnect with the things that really matter to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Casey Hagen</name></author><summary type="html">Spoiler alert: This a long-winded post about my life at this point.
