# So here's what happened.

We started off the new year pretty terribly, with only a little bit of money in our account. I was still within the 30 day refund period for my website hosting, and canceling was a quick way to make some many back, so I did it. I still have the domain name until 2020, but no hosting, so here I am, revisiting Jekyll once again.
